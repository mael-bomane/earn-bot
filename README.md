# Earn Bot

## Description

Telegram Bot for [Superteam Earn](https://earn.superteam.fun) notifications.

This project uses the following technologies :

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) backend
- [telegraf.js](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) telegram framework
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) cache
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM

## Project setup

### Environment Variables

You can find an exhaustive `.env.example` at the root of this repository.

### Initial Setup

```bash
# run install 
$ pnpm i
# generate prisma client based on `prisma/schema.prisma`

# development only, creates tables in the local database
$ npx prisma db push
```

### Local Database

This project includes a `docker-compose.yaml` file to expose a `MySQL` database, along with a `Redis` cache on localhost.

In production, these are expected to be passed as `mysql://` and `redis://` to environment variables.
